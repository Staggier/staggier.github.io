                The field of computer science is a vast one filled with many learning oppurtunities at every corner,
                throughout my years of studying at John Abbott College I have been able to learn many things inside and
                outside of my studies. One thing in particular that has stood out to me is my love for problem solving, 
                there are very few things in life that bring me the satisfaction that finally getting over a tough problem
                would give me. With that in mind I have been able to really throw myself at any challenge that comes my way,
                regardless of its difficulties.

                Something I have come to enjoy about Computer Sciences is the fact that its challenges come in many forms, and
                isn't limited in one area at all. Whether it's coming up with solutions for improving a website's quality of life,
                or fine tuning some aspect within a game, it's always something I'll find myself interested in and spending hours on
                for my own enjoyment. On top of that there's no better motivation than seeing my own progress as I learn and experience more
                challenges within the field.

      Over the years I have tackled many kinds of problems on various problem solving websites such as 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> </li>
        <li> <a href="https://open.kattis.com">Kattis</a> </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a> </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        and more, but there are a few problems that have stuck out to me and I've found really interesting to solve. 
        My favorite problems have all come from Project Euler, which has a wide range of problems with varying difficulties.
        With such a vast amount of problems with overlapping areas, it's always fun to continue learning and then profiting
        from that learning when tackling other problems.

        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout my years at John Abbott college I've gotten the chance to work on some interesting projects, and I'd
            like to share them with you. Starting with a group project I worked on with <a href="https://github.com/terror">Liam Scalzulli</a>
            during the Winter 2020 semester, a COVID bubble simulation. Using a HTML canvas, we created bubble objects that behaved
            certain ways upon collision with other bubbles. This project was fun to collaborate on, and helped me get familiar with how
            the canvas could work in future game related projects.

            Although not the first game I've made, I would say 'Vector Space' was the first project I was really proud of making on my own.
            I worked on this project during the Winter 2020 semester. Creating this game had its challenges, and its difficulties forced me 
            to see just how much I have left to learn. However, with every project I'm only learning and furthering my experience in the field.

            'Dungeon Descent' was the last game I made and it was a significant improvement upon my last, as I had learned many new concepts during my Game Programming class
            at John Abbott in the Fall 2021 semester. The difficulties and issues I had in the last project were improved upon here, such as performance and
            general fluidity within the game's movements and other aspects similar to that. Being able to see the difference in these two projects despite the small time
            between them is highly motivating for me to keep creating more projects and continue improving on my game development.
