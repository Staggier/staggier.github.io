Currently on track to graduating from John Abbott College this fall. During my studies, I have found many interests that have really given me an appreciation for Computer Sciences. With an all around love for programming I find myself enjoying a range of topics. From web programming to game development, each has intriguing aspects that draws me to them. Overall I'd say I really enjoy seeing my progress, and things like game and app development allow that easily. Similarly to visual progress, I also enjoy the satisfaction of problem solving. There's almost nothing better than finally coming up with a working solution to a tough problem.

Through the years I've picked up many skills, and I look forward to learning more as time goes on. These skills contain but are not limited to those listed below:
